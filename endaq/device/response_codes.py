"""
Response codes to various commands. Responses from the device are all
integers; these enumerations give them some context. This is important, as
some common numbers have different meanings in different types of response.

All response code values are interchangable with `int`, and function as
if they are subclasses of `int`. They can be used with integers in
comparisons and other expressions; they can even be used as array indices.

The class names match EBML element names.
